# Efficient-Dynamic-Round-Robin-Algorithm
Operating systems are resource managers. The resources managed by operating systems are hardware, storage units, input devices, output devices and data. Operating systems perform many functions such as implementing user interface, sharing hardware among users, facilitating input/output, accounting for resource usage, organizing data, etc.

Whenever CPU becomes idle, a waiting process from ready queue is selected and CPU is allocated to that. The performance of the scheduling algorithm mainly depends on CPU utilization, throughput, turnaround time, waiting time, response time, and context switch. In Round Robin a small unit of time is used which is called Time Quantum or Time slice. The CPU scheduler goes around the ready queueallocating the CPU to each process for a time interval up to1 time quantum. If a processâ€™s CPU burst exceeds 1 time quantum, that process is pre-empt and is put back in the ready queue .If a new process arrives then it is added to the tail of the circular queue. RR provides better performance as compared to the others in case of a time sharing operating system.
